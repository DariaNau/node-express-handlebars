# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description

This application is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 
* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
